## TICK

-   I'm thinking about don't simulate the game in every loop, I wanna to simulate when it is need, it means that
    I'll process the inputs when I'm going to send the data, to do that I'll need to calculate the total delta time passed, maybe it can works, or maybe not, because some important thing can happens durring this "sleep" time
    I need also knows what happened in every tick, so maybe it's not a good idea.
